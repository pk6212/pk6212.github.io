        <h2>Who Is Butters?</h2>
        <p>Leopold "Butters" Stotch is a fictional character in the adult animated television series South Park. He is loosely based on co-producer Eric Stough and his voice is provided by co-creator Matt Stone. He is a student at South Park Elementary School.</p>
        
        <h2>Butter's Personality</h2>

As a result, he is often sheltered and unknowledgeable of some of the suggestive content his peers understand, and is also frequently bullied by Eric Cartman.</p>
